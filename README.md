# Project
Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis
1. Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end data analytics workflow—from loading raw data in Python to performing EDA, cleaning datasets, running SQL queries, building a Power BI dashboard, generating insights, and preparing a final presentation using Gamma.
It demonstrates practical skills in Python, SQL, data visualization, and reporting.

2. Dataset

Source: (Specify source — e.g., Kaggle, company-provided, or sample dataset)

Format: CSV

Size: (Add number of rows/columns)

Key Fields: (Add example fields: CustomerID, Product, SalesAmount, Date, etc.)

3. Tools & Technologies

Python – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn for EDA

SQL Databases – PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Power BI – Interactive dashboard development

Gamma App – Automated slide deck generation

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

4. Project Steps
Step 1: Load Dataset in Python

Imported data using pandas.read_csv()

Inspected schema, data types, and null patterns

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Distribution analysis, correlations

Trend and pattern identification

Step 3: Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Treated outliers

Fixed inconsistent text/date formats

Created new calculated fields for analysis

Step 4: SQL Querying

Executed analytical SQL queries on PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server, including:

Filtering and grouping

Joins

Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

Window functions (if applicable)

Step 5: Power BI Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard featuring:

KPI Cards (Total Revenue, Orders, etc.)

Trend charts

Breakdown by category/region

Filters & slicers

Step 6: Reporting

Summarized key findings

Highlighted important business insights

Documented metrics, anomalies, and recommendations

Step 7: PPT Creation using Gamma

Converted insights into a clean, structured slide deck

Included visuals from Python & Power BI

Ensured storyline clarity and executive-friendliness
